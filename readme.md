# Spike - Frank Template

My template for [spike](https://github.com/static-dev/spike). For use with legacy servers and PHP. This is a customised fork of [spike base template](https://github.com/static-dev/spike-tpl-base) and it'll probably be of no use to you, other than inspiration. 

## Includes

* [Spike Frank](https://github.com/adamkiss/spike-frank)
* SugarML, Sass, ES6
* PHP support for legacy stuff
* rsync of `public` and `include` folders

## Gotchas

Will note those "later".

## Options

- **name** (name of the site)
- **description** (a short description of the site)
- **author** (name of the author)
- **server** (rsync target)
